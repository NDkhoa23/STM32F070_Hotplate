Hotplate Project with STM32F070


Hardware Design: Schematics and PCB layout for the hotplate control circuit.
Firmware: Embedded code for STM32F070 to manage temperature control, user input, and display.
Components: Information on used components including the optocoupler, TRIAC, NTC thermistor, and others.
Documentation: Instructions and notes on how to assemble, calibrate, and operate the hotplate.
This project demonstrates temperature regulation techniques, including PWM control and phase control, to maintain precise heating for various applications.
